Data used to create constraints based on an SQLITE3 antibody database of the PDB from June 2012.

3168 CDR sequences

2.8 A res cutoff
.3 R factor cutoff
Non-Redundant by sequence of CDRs per CHAIN
-CDRs thrown out if a chain did not have all three CDRS!

Reduncancy by:
  ->Lowest Resolution
   ->Lowest R
    ->Highest Chain Length
