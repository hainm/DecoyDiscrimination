# DecoyDiscrimination
Rosetta Community-Wide Benchmark -- Decoy Discrimination 

================
Dataset contents
================

Each dataset contains:

    1000 structures representing the lowest-energy structures binned in RMS space. 
    The structures were generated using Mike Tyka's loophash protocol, are stored as silent files, and have been relaxed with score12.


==================
Evaluation metrics
==================

Evaluation uses a measure from Mike Tyka, where energies are normalized such that 0 = 5%ile energy and 1 = 95%ile energy. 
Then the energy gap between the lowest-energy native and lowest-energy non-native model is calculated (lower value = deeper energy well for native). 
This is averaged over 6 different "threshold" values at which we call a structure native: 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6Ã… RMSD from the crystal structure. 
A script for computing this score is attached. To run the discrimination script:

./disc [file containing list of scorefiles]

Description
===========

Benchmark name: Decoy discrimination (landscape energy evaluation)

Benchmark subsets: Two sets as described above

Overview: 
    Set 1 (assembled by Mike Tyka) was specifically chosen where score12 has a poor energy landscape. 
    Set 2 (assembled by Patrick Conway) was chosen as an independent validation set; consequently, Rosetta's discrimination is better on set2 than on set1 using score12 and talaris2014.
